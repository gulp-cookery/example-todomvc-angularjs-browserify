# example-todomvc-angular-browserify

This repository was forked from [angularjs-gulp-example](https://github.com/jhades/angularjs-gulp-example), to demonstrates rewriting gulpfile.js using gulp-chef. Also check out the great article: "[A complete toolchain for AngularJs - Gulp, Browserify, Sass](http://blog.jhades.org/what-every-angular-project-likely-needs-and-a-gulp-build-to-provide-it/)" from the author.
